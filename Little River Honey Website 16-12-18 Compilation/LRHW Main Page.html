<h1>Little River Honey
    <h3>About Us</h3>
        Up at our "Little River" property, in the eucalyptus forests north of Bulahdelah, we keep about Thirty <a href="LRHW Hives.html">hives</a> of bees all year round. We look after the bees and help them control insect invaders, disease and adverse weather conditions.<br>
These hives provide us with an excellent supply of native forest <a href="LRHW Products.html">Honey</a> that we sell locally. There are no genetically modified plants in the forage area of the bees and no chemicals are used in or near the hives.<br>
The native forest on our property consists primarily of Ironbark, Bloodwood, Mahogany, Blue Gum, Grey Gum, Spotted Gum, Tallowood and Brushbox. These Australian native trees flower irregularly, but when they do flower the produce vast quantaties of blossom with the associated copious quantaties of nectar that our bees collect enthusiastically.<br>
When a spiecies of tree is blossoming the bees cannot be distracted. There is a sense of excitement in the air with every avaliable bee collecting nectar from dawn until dusk.<br>
Our bees are not moved from place to place on a truck and hence do not suffer the associated stress of moving. As a result our honey will allways retain the local hardwood forest flavours of the Upper Myall catchment. Unlike other beekeepers we do not feed suger to the bees, instead we make sure that we leave enough honey in the hive so that the bees do not go hungry when the flowers are less plentiful.<br>
