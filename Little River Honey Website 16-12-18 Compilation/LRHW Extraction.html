<h1>Honey Extraction</h1>
    When a hive is full of <a href="LRHW Products.html">Honey</a> we carefully remove the capped frames of surpluss honey and extract the honey on the same day using a small stainless steel centrifuge. We decant the honey about a week later after some settlling and filtration through a 500 micron stainless steel sieve.<br>This honey is as natural as it gets. Everything we do between the bee hives and the jars is done without adding heat. We don't use hot knives and we don't pasturise or heat treat the honey in any way.<br>
Everything is done as simply as possible at a steady slow pace to keep the bees calm and to preserve the natural <a href="LRHW Health.html">benefits</a> of the honey that the bees have produced. As a result the <a href="LRHW FLavours.html">flavours</a> of the various blossoms are retained in our honey. <br>The characteristic flavours of species such as Bloodwood, Ironbark and Mahogany can be clearly identified.
