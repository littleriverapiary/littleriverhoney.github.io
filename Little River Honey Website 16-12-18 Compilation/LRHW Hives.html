<h1>The Hives</h1>
    Each bee hive has between 30 and 50 thousand bees. Only one of these bees is the queen bee who lays all the eggs. All of the other bees in the hive are her children. A few hundred are Drones (male bees), all the rest are worker bees (immature females) who do everything that needs doing around the hive, they feed the queen, drones and baby bees. They produce honey comb in a intricate hexagon pattern and store honey for later when flowers are less plentiful. Bee eggs take three weeks to grow throught the larval stage and hatch, the worker bees then live for another four to six weeks, the Queen bee can live up to four years but is usually replaced after one or two years.
