<h1>Crystalisation</h1>
    Our honey can, and does <q>Candy</q> or crystalyse after some time. Only pure, raw honey does this. The jar can be placed in warm, not boiling water to reliquify if needed. Please do not use a microvave as this will destroy many of the natural health benefits of the honey. Edible honey has been found in 3000 year old Egyptian tombs... Honey has an excellent shelf life.
